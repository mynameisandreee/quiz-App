# quiz-App

## Description 
This is app built mainly on JavaScrpt. I used HTML to structure the the app and CSS to style the app to my liking. On my JavaScript I use many different functionality. I used the lessons I the learned from class. For example, creating an element using Javascript and giving it some attributes like class and also changing the text using .textContent. One feature of this app that uses that would be the time counter. It changes the count of the  time every second. and another example that appended using Javascript is the reset button and the input box where the user can reset the quiz and start from the beginning of the quiz and submit the users name to add to the scoreboard. The scoreboard displays the score of all the users that submit their name and score. When you start the app the time from 100 goes down and if you get a question wrong the you will get -10 seconds deduction to your time and your final time would be you score. And it store the name and score in the localstorage.
